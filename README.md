This'll be interesting..

So far, have created a recipe website with some minor CSS using the skills learned.

HTML examples present: buttons, links, u/o lists, different headers, titles, different file paths.

CSS examples present: external/internal/inline, multiple types of selectors.


Will attempt to continue to build upon while I learn new things, and eventually make things a little cleaner as I go. (For now, I'm just building based on what I'm learning and popping in here and there to either clean up something potentially redundant, or make the formatting a little prettier)
