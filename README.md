This'll be interesting..

So far, have created a recipe website with some minor CSS using the skills learned.

HTML examples present: buttons, links, u/o lists, different headers, titles, different file paths.

CSS examples present: external/internal/inline, multiple types of selectors.


For now, I'm just building based on what I'm learning and popping in here and there to either clean up something potentially redundant, or make the formatting a little prettier
