    <p>Sudden craving for brownies? Chocolatey desires overriding all discipline and restraint? Don't worry, to make these low cal brownies all you need is a bowl, a whisk, and a few simple ingredients. These brownies are also freezer friendly! So, if you are looking to not feel too guilty, you can simply freeze any leftovers for later!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted and HOT</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon coconut oil</li>
            <li>1 1/8 cup white granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/2 cup all purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F</li>
            <li>Lightly grease an 8-inch square baking pan with cooking oil spray. Line with parchment paper; set aside</li>
            <li>Combine hot melted butter, oil and sugar together in a medium-sized bowl. Whisk well for about a minute. Add the eggs and vanilla; beat until lighter in colour</li>
            <li>Sift in flour, cocoa powder and salt. Gently fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until comfortably combined (be careful not to over beat)</li>
            <li>Pour batter into prepared pan, smoothing the top out evenly (if you're really feeling it, now's the time to top with chocolate chunks/chips)</li>
            <li>Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the centre of the brownies in the pan no longer jiggles (the brownies will keep baking in the hot pan out of the oven). If testing with a toothpick, the toothpick should come out dirty for fudge-textured brownies</li>
            <li>Remove and allow to cool to room temperature before slicing into desired sized brownies</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Enjoy!</p>
