    <p>Tired of regular old Kraft Dinner? Probably not (because it's arguably perfect on its own), but if you're looking to mix it up here's an excellent recipe to satisfy your mac and cheese cravings, with a twist!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1.5lb elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon powdered mustard</li>
        <li>3 cups milk</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 package shredded sharp cheddar (~450g)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Topping</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li><em>Optional:</em>cook a pack of bacon on the side, cut into small pieces, add after cooking for some extra oomph!</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F</li>
        <li>In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the pasta to al dente</li>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking, in a separate pot melt the butter. Whisk in the flour and mustard and continue to gently mix for about five minutes (keep it moving and make sure it's free of lumps). Add the milk and paprika, stir, and simmer for ten minutes.</li>
        <li>Temper in the egg. Stir in 3/4 of the pack of cheese. Season with salt and pepper. Fold macaroni into the mix and pour into an appropriate sized casserole dish. Coat top with remaining cheese</li>
        <li>For the topping, melt the butter in a saute pan and toss in the bread crumbs to coat. Top the macaroni with the bread crumbs. Bake for approx. 30 minutes. Remove from oven and rest for 5 minutes before serving</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Enjoy!</p>
